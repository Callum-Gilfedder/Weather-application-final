Comments:
- The weather Object I created in App.js repeats itself massively. For a small project like this one, accessing each of the elements from the 
JSON data seems suitable. Writing a function for the purpose of not repeating myself (DRY) seems like overkill for a project this size.
- The html has a similar issue but I can use a map to render this.

To-do: 
- Seperate code into components?
